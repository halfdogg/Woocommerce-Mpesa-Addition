# Woocommerce-Mpesa-Addition
My include of Mpesa payment gateway into Woocommerce

We have to make changes in two places:
- class-wc-payment-gateways.php
Location: woocommerce/includes/class-wc-payment-gateways.php
WooCommerce Payment Gateways class - Loads payment gateways via hooks for use in the store.

- class-wc-gateway-mpesa.php
New Mpesa Gateway
Location: woocommerce/includes/gateways/mpesa/class-wc-gateway-mpesa.php
